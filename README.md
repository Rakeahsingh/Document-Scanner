# Document Scanner App with Jetpack Compose and Google ML Kit
## Features
- Document scanning using the device's camera
- Automatic edge detection and perspective correction
- Image processing for enhancing scanned documents
- Export scanned documents as images or PDF files
- Integration with Google ML Kit for OCR (Optical Character Recognition)

## Technologies Used
- Kotlin: Kotlin is a modern programming language used for Android app development. It offers concise syntax, null safety, and interoperability with Java.

- Jetpack Compose: Jetpack Compose is a modern UI toolkit for building native Android UIs. It allows developers to build UIs declaratively using Kotlin code, simplifying the UI development process and enabling UI customization.

- Android Studio: Android Studio is the official IDE for Android app development. It provides a comprehensive set of tools for building, testing, and debugging Android applications, along with support for Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

- Google ML Kit: Google ML Kit is a mobile SDK that brings Google's machine learning expertise to Android and iOS apps. It provides ready-to-use APIs for tasks such as text recognition, image labeling, face detection, and barcode scanning, allowing developers to integrate machine learning capabilities into their apps with ease. In this project, Google ML Kit is utilized for document scanning functionality, including edge detection, perspective correction, and optical character recognition (OCR).

- Coil:  Coil is a lightweight image loading library for Android that provides fast, efficient, and customizable image loading capabilities.
